## Meeting Goal:

Align on scope, requirements, and approach for new OIDC login feature.

## User Experience & Requirements:

Which identity providers do we need to support? (Google, Microsoft, custom enterprise providers?)
What's the expected user flow for first-time vs. returning users?
How do we handle account linking if users have existing accounts?
What user data do we need to collect/store from the identity provider?

## Technical Scope:

Are we replacing existing auth or adding OIDC as an additional option?
What's our fallback strategy if OIDC fails?
Do we need admin controls for managing provider configurations?

## Business Context:

What's driving this feature request? (compliance, user feedback, enterprise sales?)
Are there specific enterprise customers waiting for this?
What's the timeline and any hard deadlines?

## Design Considerations:

How should provider selection be presented to users?
What branding requirements exist for different providers?
How do we handle error states and edge cases?

## Next Steps:

Define MVP scope and phased rollout approach
Identify any external dependencies or approvals needed
